# PennState: Parse the GPS track coordinates
# 2019/04/29

# Import the file csv file
# Read the header line
# Loop through the header line to find the index positions of the "lat", "long"
# Read rest of the lines line by line
# Find the values in the list corresponding to lat and long coordinates and write them to a new list


# Import csv module to work with
import csv

# Open gps track data
# no need the data to be in .csv format to work with csv package
gpsTrack = open("C:\\Users\\mpotterf\\Dropbox\\PennState\\L4\\gps_track.txt", "r") # "r" - read only

# Once file is open, we can create a csv reader object
csvReader = csv.reader(gpsTrack)  # this object is like a cursor

# Read first the header line, as it is different from other lines
header = csvReader.next()

# Get the indexing of the "lat" "long" instead of hardcode index values
latIndex = header.index("lat")
lonIndex = header.index("long")

# Process the rest of lines using a for loop
# Make an empty list
coordList = []

# Loop through each row to get coordinates
# list and append the coordinates to final list
for row in csvReader:
    lat = row[latIndex]
    lon = row[latIndex]
    coordList.append([lat,lon])
